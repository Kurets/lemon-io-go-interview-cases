#  Lemon.io Interview Cases Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a curated list of coding cases designed for use in GO technical interviews by lemon.io!
Each case is accompanied by:

- **Task Description**: A detailed explanation of the problem statement.
- **Examples**: Sample inputs and expected outputs to clarify the requirements.
- **Tests**: Comprehensive test cases to verify implementations.
- **Implementation Examples**: Example solutions demonstrating possible approaches.

The repository is structured to facilitate both interviewers and interviewees in discussing, solving, and evaluating
coding challenges efficiently.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a resource for conducting technical interviews. The cases focus on a
variety of topics, including:

- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Concurrency
- System Design Patterns
- Real-world Problem Solving

By leveraging these cases, interviewers can assess candidates' problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and ability
to think critically under time constraints.

## Structure

Each case is presented in a separate directory and contains:

1. **Task Description**:
    - A markdown file explaining the problem and requirements.

2. **Example Implementation**:
    - A Go implementation demonstrating how the problem could be solved.

3. **Tests**:
    - Unit tests written to validate the correctness and performance of i
